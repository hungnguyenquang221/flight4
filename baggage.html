          <i style="font-size: 24px" class="fas">&#xf105;</i> BAGGAGE ALLOWANCE
        </h2>
        <p>
          When you fly, there are limits to the weight and/or number of pieces
          of baggage you can check in or carry on board. Certain limitations and
          restrictions also apply, and these may differ by country and airline.
          Your check-in and cabin baggage may also be subjected to security
          measures mandated by the relevant authorities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since you won’t have access to baggage that you have checked in, we
          recommend that you carry all your travel documents, medication and
          valuables in your cabin baggage, which will be with you throughout
          your flight. You should also remember to label your checked baggage
          with your name and contact information.
        </p>

          <i style="font-size: 24px" class="fas">&#xf105;</i> CHECKED BAGGAGE
        </h2>
        <p>
          Your checked baggage allowance is based on the weight or piece
          concept, depending on your final destination. When you book a flight
          with us, your free baggage allowance will be indicated on your ticket.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are strongly advised against packing valuable and fragile items in
          your checked baggage, such as:
        </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle">
          <li>Laptops</li>
          <li>Medication</li>
          <li>Securities / negotiable papers</li>
          <li>Silverware / precious metals</li>
          <li>Money / jewelry / other valuable items</li>
          <li>Business / travel / identification documents</li>
          <li>Perishable items</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you’re carrying food items in your checked baggage, the same
          considerations apply as that for your
          <a href="#cabinbg" style="color: #eabc15">cabin baggage.</a>

          When you fly with us, you can carry up to two bags into the cabin with
          you depending on your class of travel.
        </p>

        <p>
          In addition to the limitations stated here, you must also be able to
          stow your baggage securely in the overhead compartment or under the
          seat in front of you.
        </p>

        <p>
          Given the current Covid-19 pandemic, however, we encourage customers
          to travel as lightly as possible to ensure a smoother boarding
          process.

          For the safety, comfort and convenience of everyone on board, it’s
          important for us to ensure that the overhead compartments are not
          excessively full and the cabin remains clutter-free.
        </p>

        <p>
          If your cabin baggage exceeds these limits, it will be collected and
          stored in the aircraft cargo compartment. You may also have to pay for
          <a href="#addbg" style="color: #eabc15">additional baggage</a> charges
          if the combined weight or pieces of baggage exceeds your free
          allowance.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the safety and comfort of our passengers, we have the right to
          determine that any baggage or item(s) in your baggage cannot be
          permitted in the cabin or on board our flight.
        </p>
        <h3>Additional items allowed on board</h3>
        <p>
          You may carry ONE of these items with you on our flights, free of
          charge, in addition to your cabin baggage allowance (subject to
          country restrictions, where applicable):
        </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle">
          <li>Ladies’ handbag*</li>
          <li>Camera / Camera bag*</li>
          <li>Document bag*</li>
          <li>Overcoat</li>
          <li>Umbrella</li>
          <li>Laptop / Notebook in bag*</li>
          <li>
            Infant’s amenities and food for consumption on board. The total
            weight of these items should not exceed 6kg
          </li>
          <li>
            A walking stick, a pair of crutches and/or other prosthetic devices,
            if you are dependent on them
          </li>
          <li>A small amount of duty free goods (where permitted)</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="info">
          <p>
            * The maximum dimensions for these bags are 40x30x10cm each. If your
            item exceeds the total dimension of 80cm (the length, width and
            height combined), it will be counted as part of your standard cabin
            baggage allowance. You will then be required to check in either your
            cabin bag or the additional item.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3>Cabin baggage checks</h3>
        <p>
          We’ll carry out checks on our flights at check-in and prior to
          boarding. At check-in, cabin baggage that exceeds the allowed limits
          must be checked in. Prior to boarding, cabin baggage that exceeds the
          allowed limits will be collected and stored in the aircraft cargo
          compartment. Excess baggage charge may be added if the combined weight
          or pieces with the bags already checked in exceeds your checked
          baggage allowance.
        </p>

        <p>
          For faster security checks and to ensure your safety as well as that
          of our cabin crew, please observe the guidelines on the weight and
          size of carry-on luggage. This will minimise the likelihood of
          injuries, which could be caused by luggage falling from the overhead
          compartments due to excess stowage. Any cabin baggage that exceeds the
          stipulated allowances will have to be checked in. This will also help
          ensure the aircraft cabin remains clutter-free, so other passengers
          and the crew can move around easily.
        </p>

        <p>
          For the safety and comfort of both you and your fellow passengers,
          Singapore Airlines will retain the sole discretion to decide whether
          any item of your baggage will be permitted in the cabin or must be
          carried as checked baggage.
        </p>
        <h3>Food item</h3>
        <p>
          Some countries have strict restrictions on the food items you can or
          cannot carry. If you wish to carry food items with you, we advise you
          to check with the relevant authorities before you fly.

          BAGGAGE
        </h2>
        <p>
          Sometimes, you may have to carry large or heavy items with you when
          you fly. Most sporting equipment and musical instruments can be
          checked in or carried on board. Upon arrival, checked in baggage may
          come out on a different carousel than your normal baggage. Seek advice
          from airport staff and/or look for signage for outsized baggage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some restrictions apply to extremely large items or a large number of
          items. In this case you may seek assistance from our subsidiary,
          Singapore Airlines Cargo, who will be more than happy to assist you.
        </p>
        <h3>Sporting equipment</h3>
        <p>
          Your sporting equipment – such as golf clubs, surfboards, canoes,
          scuba diving apparel, skis and bicycles – counts towards your free
          baggage allowance. If you exceed this allowance, the usual
          <a href="#addbgc" style="color: #eabc15"
            >additional baggage charges</a
          >
          will apply.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you’re travelling to or from the USA, most sporting equipment is
          treated as one piece of baggage. A canoe is treated as two pieces of
          baggage. If you’re travelling to or from Canada, your sporting
          equipment will be charged according to the baggage allowance that
          applies to your journey.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are unable to accept any item above 32kg as checked baggage, and
          these items may have to be re-packed or sent as cargo.
        </p>
        <h3>Firearms as Sporting Equipment</h3>
        <p>
          Please contact your local office, should you wish to carry firearms
          and ammunition for sporting purposes, as your checked baggage. You
          will be responsible to ensure that all necessary permits and licenses
          are in order prior to your travel on Singapore Airlines.
        </p>
        <p>In addition, the following conditions shall apply:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle">
          <li>
            The ammunition must be completely removed from the firearm(s).
          </li>
          <li>
            Each passenger may only check in maximum gross weight of 5kg (11lb)
            of ammunition for his or her own use. Ammunition with explosive or
            incendiary projectiles will not be accepted.
          </li>
          <li>
            The ammunition must be securely packed in a sturdy box. Passengers
            travelling in a group must carry their ammunition in their own
            separate boxes or bags. Each box/bag/package shall not exceed the
            maximum limit of 5kg (11lb) of ammunition.
          </li>
          <li>The firearm(s) must be packed in a suitcase or firearm case.</li>
